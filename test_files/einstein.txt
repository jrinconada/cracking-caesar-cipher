This is a true-life anecdote about Albert Einstein and his theory of relativity.
After having propounded his famous theory, Albert Einstein would tour the various
Universities in the United States, delivering lectures wherever he went.
He was always accompanied by his faithful chauffeur (driver),
Harry, who would attend each of these lectures while seated in the back row.

One fine day, after Einstein had finished a lecture and was coming out of
the auditorium into his vehicle, Harry addressed him. He said,
"Professor Einstein, I’ve heard your lecture on Relativity so many times
that if I were ever given the opportunity, I would be able to deliver it to perfection myself!"

"Very well," replied Einstein, "I’m going to Dartmouth next week. They don’t know me there.
You can deliver the lecture as Einstein, and I’ll take your place as Harry!"
And so it went to be. Harry delivered the lecture without a word out of place while Einstein
sat in the back row playing "chauffeur" and enjoying a snooze for a change.

Just as Harry was descending from the podium, however, one of the research assistants intercepted
him and began to ask him a question on the theory of relativity, one that involved a lot of
complex calculations and equations.

Harry replied to the assistant, "The answer to this question is very simple!
In fact, it’s so simple that I’m going to let my chauffeur answer it!"
